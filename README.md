# Car Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices based on various features such as wheelbase, car length, horsepower, and more. The project involves exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and model training to build an effective predictive model.
## Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing the distribution of features using visualizations like KDE plots.
   - Observing relationships between features and the target variable (price).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Ensuring data consistency and preparing features for model training.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Applying machine learning algorithms to predict car prices.

### Running the Notebook
Currently, This notebook is only for viewing purposes for driving insights.

## Results
- Insights on feature importance and their impact on car prices.
- Predictions with high accuracy using trained models.

## Contributing
